This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n * accounts that have been granted it.

@title PaymentSplitter\n @dev This contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware\n that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.\n The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each\n account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim\n an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set at the\n time of contract deployment and can't be updated thereafter.\n `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the\n accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}\n function.\n NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether).

@dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and\n total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\n This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\n In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\n accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\n used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\n Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\n snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\n id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n and the account address.\n NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it\n return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this\n function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\n Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient\n alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.\n ==== Gas Costs\n Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\n only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account.

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules} to enforce additional security measures for this role.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"getRoleAdmin(bytes32)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the admin role that controls `role`.

contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract. The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set at the time of contract deployment and can't be updated thereafter. `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release} function. NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you to run tests before sending real value to this contract.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"constructor\":{\"details\":\"Creates an instance of `PaymentSplitter` where each account in `payees` is assigned the number of shares at the matching position in the `shares` array.

of the {IERC20} interface. This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.

contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and total supply at the time are recorded for later access. This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting. In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \\\"double spend\\\" attack by reusing the same balance from different accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism. Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id and the account address. NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract. Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient alternative consider {ERC20Votes}. ==== Gas Costs Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry. There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account.
